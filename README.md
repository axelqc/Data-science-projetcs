# Datathon-2021
We created this project for our first datathon and is also our first data science project.

We worked based on the SDGs goals, and we decidided to promote the SDG #3  "Good health and well-being", and to fulfill that goal we choose a stroke datase, our main goal was to predict wheather a person could have a stroke or not.

Firs, we cleaned the data using excel and python.

Second, we obtained the basic statistics of the dataset.

Third, used matplitlib to display a histogram

Finally, we trined two models to obtain a linear and a logsiic regression and see which one was more accurate of predicting strokes.
